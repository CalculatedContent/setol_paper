\section{Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (\HTSR)}
\label{sxn:htsr}

In this section, we provide an overview of the \HTSR \Phenomenology.%
\footnote{We may also refer to the \HTSR \Phenomenology as the \HTSR Theory; we use the term \Phenomenology to emphasize its empirical nature, and to distinguish it from the analytical methods used in the \SETOL approach.}
\HTSR has been presented in detail previously~\cite{MM19_HTSR_ICML,MM20_SDM,MM18_TR_JMLRversion}.%
%\footnote{\michael{MM TO DO: Provide an overview of which papers to read, and in what order.}} 
Here, we provide a self-contained summary, with an emphasis on certain technical issues that will be important for our
\SETOL. We highlight its practical application for interpreting observed behaviors in trained weight matrices, and 
we distinguish the \HTSR \Phenomenology from the analytical methods used in the \SETOL approach.
In Section~\ref{sxn:htsr_setup}, we summarize the basic \HTSR setup and results;
in Section~\ref{sxn:guass_ht_univ}, we summarize Gaussian (for \RMT) and Heavy-Tailed (for \HTRMT) Universality; and
in Section~\ref{sxn:htsr-metics}, we describe \SHAPE metrics and \SCALE metrics that arise from \HTSR.
(Here, we focus on basic methods for identifying HT correlations in the ESDs of pre-trained weight matrices; 
in Sections~\ref{sxn:empirical-test_acc},~\ref{sxn:empirical-correlation_trap} and~\ref{sxn:hysteresis_effect}, we show detailed experiments using theoretical constructs from the \HTSR \Phenomenology.)

%%(issues that arise with spuriously HT ESDs and how to deal with them will be described in Section~\ref{sxn:HT_ESDs}).
