\section{Statistical Mechanics of Generalization (\SMOG)}
\label{sxn:SMOG_main}

In this section, we review the \STATMECH approach to learning: 
both to understand how it is usually applied in \StatisticalMechanicsOfGeneralization (\SMOG) theory; 
and to understand how our \SemiEmpirical approach in \SETOL is similar to and different from the traditional approach.
We will also obtain an expression for the \GeneralizationAccuracy (or \ModelQuality $\Q^{ST}$) for the
classic \StudentTeacher (ST) model of the Linear \Perceptron (in the AA, and at high-T),
as described in \cite{SST90,SST92}.
In Section~\ref{sxn:matgen}, we will generalize this to a \LayerQuality metric, $\Q$, for a layer in a general Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),
i.e., $\Q^{ST}\rightarrow\Q$, so that $\Q$ can then be expressed in terms of the ESD of the NN layer.

\paragraph{Outline.}
Here is an outline of this section.
\begin{enumerate}[label=4.\arabic*]
\item
  \textbf{Approaches to the \SMOG.}
  In Section~\ref{sxn:trad_smog}, we explain the mapping from the \STATMECH theory of disordered systems
    to the \STATMECH theory of NN learning (\SMOG); and how our \SemiEmpirical approach (\SETOL)
    is similar to and different from the traditional approach.

  \item
      \textbf{Mathematical Preliminaries.}
    In Section~\ref{sxn:mathP}, we review mathematical details of \STATMECH, providing definitions
      and detailed derivations of quantities and expressions necessary later.  

    \item
      \textbf{Student-Teacher Model.}
      In Section~\ref{sxn:SMOG_main-student_teacher}, we discuss the setup of the \StudentTeacher (ST) model
      as a general means to estimate the \AverageGeneralizationError empirically.
      First, in subsection~\ref{sxn:ST_OP_setup}, we describe the ST setup with an operational analogy.
       Then, in subsection~\ref{sxn:SMOG_main-st_av}, we derive the (new) result for the
    ST \ModelQuality, $\Q^{ST}$, using the setup of the classic (ST) model for the
    \GeneralizationError (and accuracy) of the \Perceptron (in the AA, and at high-T).

  \textbf{Symbols and Equations.}
  In Section~\ref{sxn:appendix_A}, we summarize the important symbols and key results,
         including the dimensions of the vectors and matrices, different notations for energies,
         and key equations.
   \item
   \textbf{Summary of the \SMOG.}
         In Section~\ref{sxn:summary_sst92}, we provide a more detailed analysis of the results we derive in Section~\ref{sxn:SMOG_main-st_av}.
         In particular, in Section~\ref{app:st-gen-err-annealed-ham}, we repeat the derivations of the ST \GeneralizationError $\AVGSTGE$ and related quantities (from Section~\ref{sxn:mathP}),
         using more concrete notation to align with \cite{SST90, SST92}; and
         in Section~\ref{sxn:appendix_Gan}, we use this to derive the matrix-generalization of the ST \EffectivePotential $\EPSLR$ (as well as the normalization for the weight matrices, necessary for later).
