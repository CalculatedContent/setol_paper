\caption{In the \emph{vector} model, lowercase $m$ is the dimension of the weight vector (total parameters), which is also the number of features per sample. In the vector case, there is one free parameter -- the overlap $R$ (or angle $\theta$) between student and teacher. In the \emph{matrix} model, uppercase $N$ and $M$ are the input and output dimensions of the weight matrix, resp., giving $N\times M$ free parameters.
The total number of degrees of freedom is the number of training examples $\ND$ times the number of free parameters.}
