\subsubsection{Setup}
\label{sxn:mathP_setup}

\input{sections/data_mapping}

We imagine training a NN on $n$ training data instances, $\XVEC_{\mu}$, which are $m$-dimensional vectors,
with labels $y_{\mu}$, chosen from a large but finite-size training data set $\ADD$.
The goal of training the NN is to learn the $m$ weights of the vector $\WVEC$ by running gradient descent to minimize
a loss function $\mathcal{L}$ ($\ell_2$, cross-entropy, etc.). 
We want to model the real-world NN using a simple model from which we can obtain 
analytic expressions for the \emph{\FreeEnergy} and \emph{\GeneratingFunction} we then use to compute
Thermodynamic averages such as the \emph{\AverageGeneralizationError} $(\AVGGE)$ and
\emph{\ModelQuality} $(\Q)$ (which is our approximation to the \emph{\AverageGeneralizationAccuracy}).

\paragraph{Counting Samples and Features: $n$, $m$, $N$, and $M$}
We let the number of training samples be $n$ and the dimension 
(i.e., number of features) for each sample be $m$.  For simplicity, 
we also use $N$ (instead of $n$) and $M$ (instead of $m$), recognizing that 
\emph{in later sections} $N$ and $M$ will refer to the dimensions 
of a layer’s weight matrix (i.e., an $N \times M$ matrix). 
We stress that here, in this subsection,  $n = N$ and $m = M$ only hold for our immediate analysis, 
to avoid extra notation. When we move to matrix-based analyses, 
we will revisit (and possibly distinguish) $N$ (layer input dimension) and $n$ (training-set size).

\paragraph{Actual and Model Data and Energies.}

%In this section $n=N$  of the model and the number of training examples, and $m=M$ is the number of features.
%\footnote{In later sections, we will use capital $N$ and $M$, as $N$ will represent the number of inputs to the layer, and $M$ also will denote the normalization of the correlation matrices $(\XMAT, \AMAT)$. See, for example, Appendix~\ref{sxn:summary_sst92}.}
\michael{@charles: let's sync to clarify, I feel like we are overlaoding something here. I think there are two concepts, number of training examples, and number of free parameters. And at least four letters ($m$, $n$, $M$, and $N$). I can work on the text to clarify, but I'm not sure what is what.}
\charles{I am trying to clean this up. }


Consider having a large set $\ND$ of actual, real-world data, 
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:x}
  \XVEC_{\mu}, \MY_{\mu} \in\ADD,\;\mu=1, \cdots, \ND,
\end{align}
where $\XVEC_{\mu}$ is an $m$-dimensional real vector, \red{$\XVEC_{\mu}\in\mathbb{R}^{m}$},
$\MY_{\mu}$ is a binary label taking values $1$ of $-1$, denoted $\{-1,1\}$.
\michaeladdressed{@charles: does that notation (here and elsewhere) mean $\{-1,1\}$?}
and $\ADD$ denotes the finite-size dataset.
\michaeladdressed{Let's sync.  That ``$\in$'' is a little non-standard. Most would say $\XVEC_{\mu}\in\mathbb{R}^{m}$. But we need to be consistent throughout, and I'm not sure how you are using it. }
\red{
  Notice that $\XVEC_{\mu}$ ia normalized such that the Frobenius norm is $\tfrac{1}{m}$:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:XVEC_norm}
    \Vert\XVEC_{\mu}\Vert := \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \XVEC_{\mu,i}^{2}}=\tfrac{1}{m}
  \end{equation}
  }
We call $\XVEC^{n}$ an $n$-dimensional sample from $\ADD$.

We associate model errors
with a (change in) energy $\Delta E$. Smaller energies correspond to smaller errors and therefore better models.
For example, for the mean-squared-error (MSE) loss, one has
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:DEy}
  \Delta E_{\mathcal{L}}(\WVEC,\XVEC_{\mu},\MY_{\mu}):= (\MY_{\mu}-E_{NN}(\WVEC,\XVEC_{\mu}))^{2}  ,
\end{align}
where 
%MM%the loss is the L2 loss, $\mathcal{L}=\ell_2$, and 
$E_{NN}(\WVEC,\XVEC_{\mu})$ is output prediction of the NN, as in \EQN~\ref{eqn:dnn_energy}.

\michaeladdressed{To clarify: by modeling and ``real-worldexperiment, I think that what we are saying is that there is a training process on a particular dataset, and we are modeling the quality/generalization with the following, which includes replacing the real data with Gaussian data and the NN with a parameteric form that we will fit semi-empirically.}
\michael{@charles: we are going back and forth between Quality and Accuracy and various Errors; probably stick with errors, and introduce the Qualty/Accuracy in the subsubsection below.}
\charles{@michael: Eh?}

There is a training process on a particular dataset, and we are modeling the \Quality (or generalization accuracy)
with the following, which includes replacing the real data with Gaussian data and
the NN with a parameteric for that we will fit with a \SemiEmpirical procedure, described in later sections.
To model the data (i.e., as a Gaussian, as in \SMOG theory), we specify the following mapping
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:model_real_world_expt}
  \ADD \rightarrow \MDD,\;\;\XVEC_{\mu} \rightarrow \XImu,\;\;  \Ymu \rightarrow y_{\mu}  ,
\end{align}
where we denote the model training and/or test data instances as $(\XI,y)$ such that
\begin{align}
    \label{eqn:xi}
  \XI_{\mu}, y_{\mu} \in\MDD,\;\mu=1, \cdots, \infty  .
\end{align}
Here,  $\XImu$ is a random vector (i.e., an $m$-dimensional random variable, $\XImu\in\mathbb{R}^{m}$ ),
sampled from an i.i.d Gaussian distribution $\MDD$,
and $y_{\mu}$ denotes the (binary) label and/or NN output.
\michaeladdressed{MM: Clarify, since we are using the word model in a few different ways that will be confusing: model the training with Langevin; to compute things we model the real data with a Guassian; etc. }
\michaeladdressed{ Why is Figure~\ref{fig:data_mapping} not here? This seems like the right place for it?  }
We call $\XI^{n}$ an $n$-dimensional \emph{\ModelSample} from $\MDD$.

%
Given our model for the data, we
specify the mapping between the actual average Energies/Errors (defined below) and the ones estimated by our modelling assumptions.
We do this by defining and distinguishing between \emph{Sample Averages} over the actual real-world samples, $\NDX$,
and the \emph{Expected Values} of \ModelSamples, $\NDXIn$.
For example, we will model the \emph{\TotalDataSampleError} $\DETOPX$
%with an \emph{\EffectivePotential}, $\DETOT=n\EPSLw$,
by forming an
expected value over the model data, $\langle\cdots\rangle_{\NDXIn}$,
using the notation:
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:Emap}
  \DETOPX \xrightarrow{\text{data average}} \langle \DETOPXI \rangle_{\NDXIn} %= \DETOT = n \EPSLw.
\end{align}
\michael{I'm confused by the arrow.  To clarify, it is not like the arrows in \EQN~\ref{eqn:model_real_world_expt}? There the arrow represents real to model; here it represents pre-average of real data to post-average of modeled data? }
\michael{Im not sure what precisely that distinction is.  Are sample averages over the real data, and expected values over the Gaussian data that we are using to model the real data?}
\cformike{Thats the idea.  Expected values are a physics thing obviously; they are used to represent different things explained below.}
\michaeladdressed{Also, I dont see why there are three things on the RHS of \EQN~\ref{eqn:Emap}.}
\charles{comment on : the connection to  the matrix generalization in Section~\ref{sxn:summary_sst92}. }
\michael{When things are more mature, it's probably having a footnote during this exposition that we are not really interested in these energies directly, but instead to get overlaps/Hamiltonians, so that we can make the pivot to accuracies.}
\charles{OK put the footnote in.}

\michael{Need to smooth out the text in this subsubsection a bit.}
\charles{Get on a call, we can discuss, and just do it}

\subsubsection{Sample Averages, Expected Values, and Thermal Averages}
\label{sxn:mathP_averages}

Given the setup from Section~\ref{sxn:mathP_setup},
we will want to model the average (change in) energy,  $\DETOPX$, averaged over some $n$-size data set $\NDX$ .
We can write the \TotalDataSampleError as
using an overloaded, operator notation 
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:detopxy}
  \DETOPXY :=\sum_{\mu=1}^{n}\Delta E_{\mathcal{L}}(\WVEC,\XVEC_{\mu}, \MY_{\mu})  ,
\end{align}
where the boldface $\DETOP$ indicates this a sum over the entire set of  $n$ pairs $[\NDX, \MY^{n}]$.
We should keep in mind that this depends on the specific set of $n$ data pairs
$[(\XVEC_{\mu},\MY_{\mu})\in\ADD|\;\mu=1,\cdots,n]$, 
although later we will model the labels $\MY_{\mu}$ as the output of another NN
when describing the Student-Teacher model.
\michaeladdressed{Huh? Which one?}
%
For that reason, for now, we
will assume that the $\MY_{\mu}$ is pre-defined in $\Delta E_{\ell_2}$,
will drop the $\MY_{\mu}$ and $y^{n}$ symbols, 
and just write this total error / energy difference as
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:detox}
  \DETOPX :=\sum_{\mu=1}^{n}\Delta E_{\mathcal{L}}(\WVEC,\XVEC_{\mu})  ,
\end{align}
which is now a function of the entire set of  $n$ vectors $[\NDX]$
(where the labels $\MY$ have been implicitly set).
\michael{@charles: what is the significance of this switch? Is is to use this ``operator notation and if so what is the significance of that not having the $y$. }
\cformike{The $y$ goes away in the next section; its not obvious yet.  Likewise, the operator notation is useful later.}
This operator notation will provide useful later in Section~\ref{sxn:SMOG_main-st_av}
(see \EQN~\ref{eqn:DE_L}) and in Appendix~\ref{sxn:summary_sst92}.

We will not, however,  work directly with Samples and Sample Averages.
Instead, we will model them.
%%\michael{By that, I think we mean that it is hard to compute them, so we will model them with Gaussian random variables with a model with a parameter to fit semi-empirically to data; correct?}
%%\cformike{We discussed on the phone.  The idea is we compute the average as a derivative of a generating function that we know exactly, as opposed to say doing a monte carlo sample because the partition function $Z$ is intractable}
To that end, we need to estimate them with a theoretical approach.


\paragraph{Expected Values.}

We can \ModelSamples and Sample Averages with an \emph{\ExpectedValue}, 
which is computed by sampling from a model for the actual data distribution $\MDD$. 
\michael{@charles: that seems like a bad use of macros: ModelSamples splits out into two words, and in some places it is a noun; but here model is a capitalized verb, and ``Sample Averages'' is not a macro; and ExpectedValue is singular (the plural versus singular issue appears elsewhere with these macros).}
\michael{It may be good to have a figure, perhaps in the intro, illustrating this shift, since it seems like the key conceptual shift.}
\charles{This needs to all be done at once at the end of the proofreading}
We will denote Expected Values using physics \BraKet notion.  
For example, given a function $f(\XI)$, 
we write the expected value as:
\begin{align}
 \label{eqn:EuT}
 \langle f(\XI) \rangle_{\XI}:=\int d\mu(\XI) f(\XI)  .
\end{align}
%%
For a more complicated example, consider the expected value of the
\emph{Data Averaged Total Model Error}:
%%\michael{If I understand what is going on, we are doing two things in this sentence; we are introducing a definition, i.e., of $\DETOPXI$, which depends on the Gaussian model, and we are introducing the expected value of that.  Althouth that may be exactly or roughly the same thing as in \EQN~\ref{eqn:Emap}?}
\michaeladdressed{@charles: that's an example of emph inside emph.}
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:total_data_sample_error}
\nonumber
  \langle \DETOPXI\rangle_{\NDXIn}
  :=  &\int d\mu(\NDXIn) \DETOPXI \\ 
   = & \int \prod_{\mu=1}^{n}d\XI_{\mu}P(\NDXIn) \sum_{\mu=1}^{n}\DET
\end{align}
where $P(\NDXIn)$ is an $n$-dimensional
probability distribution (i.e., an $n$-dimensional Gaussian distribution),
and where the subscript $\NDXIn$ on the Ket reminds us this is an expected value of a finite, $n$-size \ModelSample.
\michaeladdressed{See comments above about $n$, since I was confused about $n$ was referring to, and I though $m$ was the dimensionality of the real and modeled data, and here we refer to ``$n$-dimensional Gaussian and ``$n$-size \ModelSample.}
The measure $d\mu(\NDXIn)$ signifies a $n$ i.i.d Gaussian vector $\XI$, drawn from an $m$-dimensional data model vectors $\XI$.
\michaeladdressed{@charles: clarify; that is $N$ vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{M}$ that are element-wise i.i.d. Gaussian?}
(This is used in both Sections~\ref{sxn:SMOG_main} and~\ref{sxn:matgen}.)
%%\michael{Where we are using $M$ and $N$ rather than $m$ and $n$; is that a typo, or what should it be.}
%%\cformike{I use $n,m$ in this section, $N$, $M$ elsewhere since they can mean different things when we generalize to a layer.  We can fix if its too confusion, or maybe just explain above.}
%

\red{ADDED THIS:}
\paragraph{\SizeExtensivity, \SizeIntensivity, and \SizeConsistency}
A key requirement for the \ThermodynamicLimit in \STATMECH is \emph{\SizeExtensivity}:
that physically meaningful quantities (i.e, total energies and free energies)
scale linearly with the system size, $n=N$.
Along with this, Thermodynamic average quantities should be \emph{\SizeIntensive},
meaning that they remain indepdent of $n=N$ as the system size increases.
In our setting, \SizeExtensivity and \SizeIntensivity underpin the large-N limit,
ensuring that macroscopic observables become independent of
microscopic fluctuations.

As an example of \SizeExtensivity and \SizeIntensivity, 
we write the data-average of \TotalDataSampleError $\DETOPXI$ (\EQN~\ref{eqn:total_data_sample_error})
in the large-N limit as
\begin{align}
  \lim_{n\gg 1}  \frac{1}{n}\langle\DETOPXI\rangle_{\NDXIn}=
  \lim_{n\gg 1}\frac{1}{n}
\int \prod_{\mu=1}^{n}d\XI_{\mu}P(\NDXIn)
  \sum_{\mu=1}^{n}\Delta E_{\ell_2}(\WVEC,\XI_{\mu})
\end{align}
Where the notation $(n \gg 1)$ means $n$ grows arbitrarily large, but is not necessarily
at the limit point $(n=\infty)$.
The \TotalDataSampleError $\DETOPXI$ is \SizeExtensive, whereas the
average $\frac{1}{n}\langle\DETOPXI\rangle_{\NDXIn}$ is \SizeIntensive.
This average is described below, and will be very useful in Sections~\ref{sxn:SMOG_main-st_av}
and~\ref{sxn:matgen}.
Moreover, this limit will be implicit later when taking a \SaddlePointApproximation (SPA, see below).
\footnote{As we are working within a ``physics-level of rigor, we take some liberties in evaluating these large-N limits; and we leave the formal proofs for future work. \michael{This comment should be in the intro, not in a footnote here.  Move later, since I don't have the token for the intro for now. } }

The data-averaged error  $\tfrac{1}{n}\langle \DETOPXI \rangle_{\NDXIn}$ will appear frequently below.
For compatibility with \cite{SST92}, we denote it using the symbol $\EPSLw$:
\begin{align}
 \label{eqn:epsl}
 \EPSLw:=\frac{1}{n}\langle \DETOPXI \rangle_{\NDXIn} \quad \text{(\SizeIntensive)}.
\end{align}
where, by our normalization here, $\EPSLw \in [0,1]$.
The symbol $\EPSLw$ is our theoretical estimate of the sample average $\DETOPXI$ (\EQN~\ref{eqn:detox}),
well-defined for any $n$.
We also call $\EPSLw$ the \emph{\EffectivePotential}, which will be made clear below.

\michaeladdressed{Im a little confused as to the logical flow.  We introduce the ``Total \DataModel Error (which I dont think we will use much), and then we talk about the large $n$ limit, then we introduce the ``Data-Averaged Model Error (I think to introdue the notation $\EPSLw$ which we will use a lot, but this is the thing that we are talking the alrge $n$ limit of so presumably it should be introduced first), and then we introduce the \emph{Total Data-Averaged Model Error} (Im not sure why, but I think it is since we want to connect total energy to a sum or single-particle energies, which is improtant for the SETOL approach)}
\charles{@michael: We use this later several times, such as Appendix A2, \EQN~\ref{eqn:DETOPST}}

It is also convenient to write \emph{\TotalEffectivePotential} as an Energy, 
\begin{align}
 \label{eqn:detox}
 \DETOT := n\EPSLw\quad \text{(\SizeExtensive)}.
\end{align}
This will only be useful when the \ThermodynamicLimit exists, and this
can be reasonably expected for the \AnnealedApproximation (AA),
which is the regime in which \SETOL will be developed.% 
\footnote{We should note that, while our model training and generalization errors are always expressed energies, an energy is not necessarily a model error. \michael{@charles: this seems in passing, what is the significance of this comment. If not essential, maybe remove it.} }

There is a related notion of \emph{\SizeConsistency},
often introduced in Quantum Chemistry through the Linked Cluster Theorem\cite{Hubbard1959,Brandow1963},
which states that the total energies and/or free energies of in particular a correlated system scale with $\mathcal{M}$,
the number of interacting components:
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:LCT}
  \ln Z &= \sum_{\mu=1}^{\mathcal{M}}\text{(Connected Components)} \\ \nonumber
  &= \sum_{\mu=1}^{\mathcal{M}}\text{Cumulants($\mu$)+higher order terms} 
\end{align}
Here, below, these connected components will be the matrix-generalized cumulants from RMT.
For Neural Networks, \SizeConsistency appears when scaling the number of features $\mathcal{M}=M$ in our matrix model,
and ensure that our layer and model Qualities  remain \SizeConsistent as we increase $M$, just as we do for $N$.
For a simple example, see Appendix~\ref{sxn:summary_sst92}
 where we derive the expression for the matrix-generalized
\AnnealedHamiltonian $\HAN$.  
More importantly, both \SizeExtensivity (in $N$) and \SizeConsistency (in $M$)
are crucial here:  they justify taking the large-N approximation for matrix integrals, and ensures
our resulting the HCIZ integral--a sum of integrated RMT cumulants (below)--
scales with the dimension of the \EffectiveCorrelationSpace (\ECS), $\mathcal{M}=\MECS$.


\paragraph{From Errors to Accuracies: The \AverageGeneralizationAccuracy, the \Quality, and the \SelfOverlap}
We have been discussing various forms of errors.
In \SETOL, we will, however, primarily be concerned with approximating the \emph{\AverageGeneralizationAccuracy},
or, more generally, the \Quality of a NN model and/or its layers.
\footnote{Technically, the \Quality will estimate the average \emph{Precision} rather than the Accuracy.
This will distinction will be clarified in the Section~\ref{sxn:SMOG_main-student_teacher}.}
The average accuracy is simply one minus the error, and to represent this,
we introduce the symbol $\ETA$, which is defined generally as
\begin{align}
 \label{eqn:def_eta}
 \ETA(\WVEC) := 1-\EPSLw.
\end{align}
where, with the normalizaiton here, $\ETA(\WVEC)\in[0,1]$.
We call $\ETA$ the \emph{\SelfOverlap} because it describes the overlap between the true and the predicted labels.
Unlike $\EPSLw$, however, in later sections
(~\ref{sxn:SMOG_main-st_av},~\ref{sxn:matgen_mlp3}, and Appendix~\ref{sxn:quality})
we will first define a data-dependent \SelfOverlap also, so that we may obtain
 $\ETA(\WVEC):=\langle\ETA(\WVEC,\XI)\rangle_{\NDXIn}$ directly.
\michaeladdressed{Huh, clarify.}
This will be made more clear later.

\michael{This par should probably be moved.  Probably combine with ``Other notation'' below.  To where?  The one after this may go here; but errors to accuracies is more than just a sign convention.}
\charles{I added paragraph markers; can move later}
\paragraph{Braket Notation}
We will use physics \BraKet notation, $\langle\cdots\rangle$,
to denote different kinds of averages, with superscripts and subscripts,
for expected values (estimated theoretical averages).
We use superscripts to denote the kind of average:
\begin{center}
Thermal $\langle\cdots\rangle^{\beta}$,
\Annealed $\langle\cdots\rangle^{an}$,
high-T $\langle\cdots\rangle^{hT}$,
HCIZ $\langle\cdots\rangle^{IZ}$, etc.
\end{center}
We use subscripts to emphasize the dependent variables:
\begin{center}
  weights $\langle\cdots\rangle_{\WVEC}$, $\langle\cdots\rangle_{\SVEC}$, $\langle\cdots\rangle_{\SMAT}$,
data $\langle\cdots\rangle_{\XI}$, $\langle\cdots\rangle_{\NDXIn}$, etc.
\end{center}
We also reuse these symbols for other quantities, such as the $\ZANHT$, $\AVGGE^{an,hT}$, $\GAN$, etc,
but may mix-and-match subscripts and superscripts for visual clarity.

\paragraph{Sign Conventions}
Finally, we discuss the sign conventions used.  Since errors decrease with better models,
Energies $(\DET, \DETOT, \EPSLw, \cdots)$ and Free Energies $(F)$ are minimized to obtain better models.
Likewise, since accuracies increase with better models, Qualities $(\Q, \QT, \cdots)$,
\SelfOverlap $(\ETA)$, and \Quality \GeneratingFunction $(\Gamma)$ would be maximized to obtain better models.
An exception will be Hamiltonians $(H,\mathbf{H})$, which will depend on context.

\paragraph{Thermal Averages (over weights).}

To evaluate the expectation value of some equilibrium quantity that depends on the weights $\WVEC$ (say $\mathbb{E}^{\beta}_{\WVEC}[f(\WVEC)]$), one uses a \ThermalAverage.
%%\michael{@charles: I that sentence, when you say ``expectation value you mean it in the same sense as ``expected value of model/Gaussian data rather than ``sample average of real data; is that correct?}
%%\cformike{Yes good catch.  I forget and fall back to quantum chemistry lingo sometimes}
By this, we mean a \emph{\BoltzmannWeightedAverage}: given a function $f(\WVEC)$,
we define the \ThermalAverage over $\WVEC$ as
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:thrmavg}
\langle f(\WVEC)\rangle_{\WVEC}^{{\beta}}:=\dfrac{1}{Z_{n}}\int d\mu(\WVEC) f(\WVEC)e^{-\beta \DETOT}  ,
\end{align}
where the superscript $\beta$ denotes \ThermalAverage,
$\beta=\frac{1}{T}$ is an inverse temperature, and 
$Z_{n}$ is the normalization term (or Partition function), defined as
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:Zwn}
Z_{n}:=\int d\mu(\WVEC) e^{-\beta n\EPSLw},
\end{align}
defined for the $n$-size \emph{Data Sample} $[\NDXIn]$.
%
In particular, when we want to compute the \ThermalAverage of the \emph{Total Energy} difference or Error
$\DETOT$ over $\WVEC$, we could write
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:Detot}
\langle \DETOT \rangle^{\beta}_{\WVEC}:=\dfrac{1}{Z_{n}}\int d\mu(\WVEC) \DETOT e^{-\beta \DETOT} .
\end{align}
Importantly, we will never calculate the average errors directly like this.
%%\michael{I assume that sentence is imprecise; we are not calculating average errors (of samples, so in the sese as used above), but instead computing expectations (of the model/Gaussian variables), which of course should approximate the average errors; correct?}
Instead, we will calculate them from partial derivatives of the \FreeEnergy $F$ (as shown below).
%%\charles{We discussed on the phone can rediscuss if necessary}

\paragraph{Replica Averages}
\charles{This section has been removed: see excerpt file}

\paragraph{Other Notation: Overbars, Superscripts and Subscripts}
\michael{The info in this paragraph should be elsewhere, maybe at the top of this or another section,
  right now we are knee-deep in a subsubsection.}
\charles{Where ? Maybe make this a subsection or move up ???}
As above, we may also occasionally denoted averages using the common notation for expected values, $\mathbb{E}[\cdots]$.
See Table~\ref{tab:dimensions} and~\ref{tab:symbols} in Appendix~\ref{sxn:appendix} for a list of these and other notational conventions and symbols we use.

When discussing quantities such as the \FreeEnergy $(F)$, 
training and test errors/eneries $(\mathcal{E})$, 
the \LayerQuality $(\mathcal{Q})$, etc.,
we will place a bar over the symbol (i.e., $\bar{F}$, $\bar{\mathcal{E}}$, $\Q$, etc.) when referring to
an average over $n$ (or $N$, below). 
Otherwise, we will refer to these quantities as the total (averaged) energy, error, quality, etc.

\charles{Finally, in this preliminary Section, we represent the dimensions with lower case $n,m$, but elsewhere
  (and somtimes below), we will use capital $N,M$.}
%%\michael{Are we consistent about Total versus Average, and how does that comment relate to that.}
%%\charles{I hope so}

Finally, when referring to the model (i.e., theoretical)
training and generalization errors, we will use the superscript $ST$ for
the average \StudentTeacher training and generalization errors, $\AVGSTTE$ and $\AVGSTGE$, respectively, and
the superscript $NN$ for the matrix-generalized NN layer average
training and generalization errors, $\AVGNNTE$ and $\AVGNNGE$, respectively.
When referring to empirical errors, we denoted these as $\AVGEMPTE$ and $\AVGEMPGE$, respectively.


\subsubsection{Free Energies and \GeneratingFunctions} 
\label{sxn:mathP_free_energies}

\michael{I feel like this section should be expanded slighlty.  We have lots of different partition functions and free energies floating around, and we are also using the terms for $n-F$. }

Frequently, if one needs an average energy (or error), or accuracy (or quality)
it is often easier to calculate the associated \FreeEnergy and take the corresponding partial derivative
than it is to compute it directly as an expected value a \ThermalAverage.
Generally speaking, a \FreeEnergy $F_n$ is defined in terms of $Z_{n}$ as
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:F}
\beta F_n:=-\ln Z_{n}.
\end{align}
\michaeladdressed{Should there be a subscript $n$ on $F$, or not on $Z$?}
\charles{@michael:.  Its on $Z$ to remind us of the $n$ dependence when we take the derivatives below}


Keep in mind that $Z$ may actually be a function of the data $\XI$ (or some other variables),
i.e., $Z(\XI)$, but we usually dont write this explicitly.
Likewise, while  both $F_n$ and $Z_n$ depend explicitly on the system size $n$, however,
we will only include these subscripts when emphasizing this.
Also, $F$ has units of Energy or Temperature, so $\beta F=-\ln Z$ is a kind-of unitless \FreeEnergy.

Each model and/or layer will have its own \PartitionFunction and associated \GeneratingFunctions.
We call $F$ and $Z$ \emph{\GeneratingFunctions} because they can be used to generate are the model errors (and/or accuracies). 
Given a \FreeEnergy, $F$, we can ``generate'' the training and generlization errors with the appropriate derivatives of $F$ and/or $Z$~\cite{LTS90, Solla2023}.

With out sign convention,  as the error decreases, the \FreeEnergy also decreases.
Therefore, when discussing accuracies or qualities,
we will introduce a specific \GeneratingFunction, denoted $\Gamma$, which increases
as the accuracy of quality increases.  To define $\Gamma$, one notes that
For the average quanities, one has
 $\bar{\Gamma}:=1-\bar{F}$ for the model or layer under consideration (see below).
\michaeladdressed{Maybe be more explicit which one or two we will do?}
\michaeladdressed{Check later: use this correctly for $F$ versus $Z$, and the $1 - \cdot$ version for accuracies.}
\charles{We can use both F, Z, or $\Gamma$ as needed as \GeneratingFunctions}


\subsubsection{The Annealed Approximation (AA) and the High-Temperature Approximation (high-T)}
\label{sxn:mathP_annealed}

In the traditional \SMOG approach, one models the (\Typical) generalization behavior of a NN
by defining and computing the \ExpectedValue of the \FreeEnergy of the model.
The full expected value of the \FreeEnergy, $\beta F_{n}=-\ln Z_{n}$, with respect to the (model)
  data $\NDXIn$, as:
\begin{align}
  \mathbb{E}_{\NDXIn}[\beta F]:=-\langle \ln Z_{n}(\NDXIn)\rangle_{\mathcal{D}},
\end{align}
where $\mathbb{E}_{\NDXIn}[\beta F]$ is the \ExpectedValue of the \FreeEnergy, which we wish to model, and 
where $\langle \ln Z_{n}(\NDXIn)\rangle_{\mathcal{D}}$ means where we average over all possible samples of the data
($\NDXIn$, of size $n$).  This is also called the \Quenched \FreeEnergy.
This is, however,  frequently too difficult to analyze, and doing so typically
requires a so-called Replica calculation. And while we will be doing something similar
to a Replica calculation later, for the setup of the problem, we will use a simpler approach.

The \AnnealedApproximation (AA) is a way of taking the data-average \emph{first}, and greatly
simpifies the model under study and its analysis.  The standard way to move forward is to follow the methods used
in disordered systems theory \cite{SST92,EB01_BOOK}.
The mapping is:
%\begin{center}
\begin{align*}
  &\mbox{Average over the Data }&\leftrightarrow& \quad\mbox{\AnnealedApproximation}    &\leftrightarrow& \quad\mbox{Disorder Average} \\
  &\mbox{Learning the Weights }      &\leftrightarrow& \quad\mbox{NN Optimization Algorithm} &\leftrightarrow& \quad\mbox{\ThermalAverage}  .
\end{align*}
%\end{center}
\michaeladdressed{I get the left and right column, but not the middle; an approximation, which is computing something in some regime, seems to be a different ``type than an optimization algorithm.}
\charles{In training an NN, one first learns the weights $\WVEC$
  through the NN optimization algorithm,
  and then evaluates the training or test accuracy
  by averaging over the (actual) data $\NDX$.
  In the theoretical analysis, however, the steps are reversed.
  One first averages over the (model) data $\NDXIn$ (i.e., a multi-variate Gaussian distribution)
  so that the disorder (variability in the data) is averaged out.
  Then, a \ThermalAverage is used to model the final state of NN learning process, the learned weights.
}


%, or \Replicas, $[\NDXIn]$ of size $n$, %
%chosen from the same data distribution $\mathcal{D}$, and indexed by $r$.
%In this case, we say that the system is quenched to the disorder, and we are performing a \emph{\Quenched} Average over $\mathcal{D}$.

\michaeladdressed{I think that we are using $\NDX$ and $\NDXIn$ somewhat inconsistently. And I think that is since we are going to a lot of effort to talk about replicas, etc.  We may be able to modularize some of this replica stuff to the appendix, since it's distracting to reader---it's taking a lot of time to get to the annealed hamiltonian, which is what we want to get to.  This feels a bit more like the advanced stuff that we have in Appendix~\ref{sxn:summary_sst92}, but where we do the less precise derivation in the main text; we may want to do that here, saying that there is an approach that sawps integrals to make life easier (see the appendix for a more detailed analysis, where wer derive it more precisely), and that gives the AA that gives us the annealed hamiltonian that is our staritng point.  That would also make this section shorter, which would be good.}
\charles{Cleaning this up}

\paragraph{The Annealed Approximation (AA)} 
Formally, the AA makes the substitution
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:AA}
\mathbb{E}_{\NDXIn}[\beta F]:=-\langle\ln Z_{n}(\XI)\rangle_{\mathcal{D}}\approx-\ln \langle Z_{n}(\XI)\rangle_{\mathcal{D}}.
\end{align}
Here, we are \emph{averaging over the disorder}.
We may associate $-\langle\ln Z_w(\NDXIn)\rangle_{\mathcal{D}}$ to the (unitless) \Quenched \FreeEnergy, and
$-\ln \langle Z_{n}(\NDXIn)\rangle_{\mathcal{D}}$ to the (unitless) \Annealed \FreeEnergy.
\charles{unitless is akward, rephrase}

Applying the AA amounts to applying Jensens inequality \emph{as an equality}, 
and it allows will let us interchange integrals and logarithms when computing the data average:
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:Jensens}
\ln\int d\mu(\NDXIn)(\cdots)\leftrightarrow \int d\mu(\NDXIn)\ln(\cdots)   .
\end{align}
This will allow us to switch the order of the data and the thermal averages, i.e.,
\begin{align}
 \label{eqn:switch}
\langle\THRMAVGw{\cdots}\rangle_{\NDXIn}\rightarrow\THRMAVGw{\langle\cdots\rangle_{\NDXIn}}   ,
\end{align}
greatly simplifying the analysis.

\michaeladdressed{MM TO DO: I moved this par from elsewhere. I still need to weave it into this section better.}
The use of the AA is common in \STATMECH, as it simplifies computations considerably; and 
it is chosen when it holds exactly (if, say, $x$ is a \Typical sample from $\mathcal{D}$ and $Z_w(\XI)$ has a well defined mean).
In contrast, there are situations in \STATMECH when the average is \ATypical, and then it one can get different results for the \Quenched versus \Annealed cases.  In a practical sense, one imagines this may occur when the data is very
noisy and/or mislabeled, and this requires a special treatment~\cite{SST92}.

\paragraph{Annealed Hamiltonian $\GAN$.}

When we apply the AA (as in \EQN~\ref{eqn:Jensens}), 
we average over the data $\NDXIn$ first. 
This will allow us to develop a theory in terms a (Temperature dependent) \EffectivePotential. 
%
%, $\DETeff$, which looks formally as if it is defined
%over a  single example $\XI$
% \begin{align}
%   \label{eqn:Gan_def}
%   \GAN:= - \ln  \int d\mu(\XI)e^{-\beta\DETeff} 
% \end{align}
Following~\cite{SST92} (see \EQN(2.30)), we will call this the \emph{\Annealed Hamiltonian} $\GAN$, 
\michaeladdressed{If the rule is to put things in italics the first time they are used and defined, we should probably do it here for that.}
which we define as  %%We define the \Annealed Hamiltonian $\GAN$ as
  \begin{align}
   \label{eqn:Gan_def}
   \beta\GAN:= - \frac{1}{n}\ln  \int d\mu(\NDXIn)e^{-\beta\DETOPXI}.
  \end{align}
% defined as the average of the data-averaged error of a sample $\NDXIn$.
% The \Annealed Hamiltonian
The \AnnealedHamiltonian is a simple ``mean-field-like'' Hamiltonian for the problem,
and it is a critical piece needed to generalize the vector-based ST \Perceptron model to the matrix-generalized ST MLP model.

Using $\GAN$, we can define the \emph{Annealed Parition Function}, $Z^{an}_{n}$, as
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:Zan_def}
  \ZAN :=  \int d\mu(\WVEC) e^{-n\beta \GAN}.
\end{align}
To see this is correct, let us substitute~\ref{eqn:Gan_def} into~\ref{eqn:Zan_def}, we can simplify $\ZAN$ to
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:Zan_simple}
  \ZAN &=  \int d\mu(\WVEC) exp\left[-n \left(- \frac{1}{n}\ln  \int d\mu(\NDXIn)e^{-\beta\DETOPXI}\right)\right] \\ \nonumber
  &=  \int d\mu(\WVEC) exp\left[\ln  \int d\mu(\NDXIn)e^{-\beta\DETOPXI}\right] \\ \nonumber
  &=  \int d\mu(\WVEC)  \int d\mu(\NDXIn)e^{-\beta\DETOPXI} ,
\end{align}
or, in Bra-Ket notation
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:Zan_brakets}
  \ZAN = \langle\langle e^{-\beta\DETOPXI}\rangle_{\NDXIn}\rangle_{\WVEC}
\end{align}
which is exactly what we expect using the AA, as in \EQN~\ref{eqn:switch}
(but where we leave the $\beta$ superscript off the outer Ket,
i.e., $\langle\cdots\rangle_{\WVEC}$,  because the \ThermalAverage is explicit.).

Later, however, we will only need the high-T version $\HANHT$, and this takes a very simple form.
\footnote{We derive expressions for $\EPSL(R)$ and $\AVGSTGE(R)$ in \EQN~\ref{eqn:e0} and \EQN~\ref{eqn:AVGSTGE_R}, respectively, using relatively simple arguments.
in Appendix~\ref{app:st-gen-err-annealed-ham} we present
a more detailed derivation of $\GANR$ and $\GANHTR=\EPSL(R)$
in Appendix~\ref{sxn:appendix_Gan} we show that this derivations generalizes to the matrix-generalized case, $\GANMAT$.
This more detailed derivation is important for our \SETOL setup because it lets us define the normalization
necessary for the \TRACELOG condition.
\michaeladdressed{@charles: would you modify that, since I know some of the wording is imprecise. The goal of this as a footnote is not to give a full outline, but just to make a passing remark and not loose the flow of text. A more detailed version of that justification will need to be later.}

\paragraph{The High-Temperature (High-T) Annealed Hamiltonian $(\HANHT(\WVEC)=\EPSLw)$ and Partition Function $(\ZANHT)$. }
%\paragraph{High-Temperature Approximation.}
In addition to the AA, we will be evaluating our models at at high-T.
Notably, the \AnnealedHamiltonian $\HAN(\WVEC)$ in \EQN~\ref{eqn:Gan_def} is a non-linear function of $\beta$; by
taking the high-T approximation, we can remove this dependence and obtain
the simpler expression that $\HAN(\WVEC)=\EPSLw$.  This greatly simplifes both
the \PartitionFunction, i.e.,  $\ZANHT$, and subsequent results (below).

%In particular, deriving \EQN~\ref{eqn:Gan_highT_final} used the high-T approximation. 
%Here, we describe it in more detail.
\michaeladdressed{If it is too awkward to move this high-T discussion to before we use it above, then we should have some sort of signpost that explicitly notes that we did that. I can weave that in, once I understand the logical flow.}
%We can form a  \emph{High Temperature} (High-T) \emph{Approximation} if we expand $Z_{n}$ in a Taylor series in $\beta$.
%\michael{Are we going to do high-T expansion of $Z$ or $\HAN$ or what?  aWe should probably describe it here in a way that each of those can plug into.}

Consider \EQN~\ref{eqn:Zan_brakets} for the Parition Function $Z_{n}$.
To obtain the high-T result, we can write the Taylor expansion for $e^{\beta\DETOPXI}$ and keep
the first two terms:
\begin{align}
  e^{-n\beta\DETOPXI} \simeq \underbrace{1 - \beta\DETOPXI}_{high-T}+ (\beta\DETOPXI)^{2} + \cdots  .
\end{align}

%The high-T approximation resembles the AA (or, rather, Jensens inequality as an equality), when applied to the \ThermalAverage as opposed to the data averages
%%%%\nred{Something wrong here}
%%%If we now evaluate $Z_{n}^{\red{an}}$ at high-T, we obtain
%%%\begin{align}
%%%  \red{\ZANHT}=\int d\mu(\WVEC)e^{-n\beta\EPSLw}
%%%  &\approx \int d\mu(\WVEC) (1-n\beta\EPSLw) \\ \nonumber
%%%  & = \int d\mu(\WVEC) - \int d\mu(\WVEC) n\beta\EPSLw \\ \nonumber
%%%  & =-  \red{1-??}\int d\mu(\WVEC) n\beta\EPSLw 
%%%\end{align}
%%%%If, in analogy with \EQN~\ref{eqn:Jensens}, 
%%%%we switch the order of the integral and the logarithm, we obtain the same result as the high-T approximation:
%%%%  \begin{align}
%%%%    \int d\mu(\WVEC) \ln e^{-n\beta\EPSLw}
%%%%    &= -\int d\mu(\WVEC)n\beta\EPSLw
%%%%  \end{align}
%%%%  
%%%%And while one might think of a high-T approximation as an ``aggressive'' application of the AA, 
%%%%the intent of the two approximations are different.
%%%%The AA suppresses the effects of disorder in the data; 
%%%%consequently, it misses the spin-glass phase transition that arises when severely overfitting the data.
%%%This simple expression shows that  high-T approximation suppresses complex interactions between the weights,
%%%and results in a simple or naive average
%%%%consequently, when combined with the AA, at high-T, the training and generalization errors become equivalent.
%%%At high-T we will define our \Annealed \PartitionFunction,
%%%$\ZANHT$, as a \ThermalAverage over the data-averaged error, $n\EPSLw$ directly:
%%%\begin{align}
%%%  \label{eqn:ZanhT}
%%%  \ZANHT :=  \int d\mu(\WVEC) e^{-n\beta \EPSLw}   .       %=  n\THRMAVGw{\EPSLw}  
%%%\end{align}
%%%%%\michael{Is this eqn different than \EQN~\ref{eqn:Zan}? They look identical.}
%%%%%\michael{@charles: there is some problem with labels. When I wrote that last comment, I was trying to refer to the equation above, not the one in the appendix.  So, two things: first, make unique labels; and second, what about the question.

%%\charles{Yeah that could be.  Maybe add some references to the sections and be clearer}
\michael{@charles: if we are going to present the AA this way, i.e., i.t.o. the partition function and not other things that we do the AA on below, then it probably makes sense to derive other things below from the partition function, rather than have each thing done separately.}
\charles{This was here but it was too long, so it is now in  in ``generating\_functions\_420\_excerpt.tex''. }


Let us now express $\GAN$ directly in terms of $\EPSLw=\tfrac{1}{n}\langle\DETOPXI \rangle_{\NDXIn}$ (see \EQN~\ref{eqn:epsl}) as a \ThermalAverage at high-T.
To do so, let's take a high-T expansion of \EQN~\ref{eqn:Gan_def} (see below for a discussion of the high-T approximation) by expanding the exponential to first order in $\beta$, to obtain
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:Gan_highT}
\beta\GANHT
=&  - \frac{1}{n}\ln \int d\mu(\NDXIn) [1-\beta \DETOPXI] \\ \nonumber
=&  - \frac{1}{n}\ln\langle 1-\beta\DETOPXI \rangle_{\NDXIn} \\ \nonumber
%=&  - \frac{1}{n}\left(\ln\langle 1\rangle_{\NDXIn}-\langle\beta\DETOPXI \rangle_{\NDXIn}\right) \\ \nonumber
\approx&\;  \frac{1}{n}\langle \beta\DETOPXI \rangle_{\NDXIn} \\ \nonumber
=&\;\frac{1}{n}\beta (n\EPSLw)\\ 
\label{eqn:Gan_highT_final}
=&\;\beta \EPSLw  .
\end{align}
Here, we have used the AA, the property that $\ln(1 + y) \approx y$, for $|y| \ll 1$, and the fact that $\EPSLw$ takes the form given in \EQN~\ref{eqn:epsl}.
This gives $\GANHT:=\EPSLw$, which is no longer a non-linear function of $\beta$.
Moving forward, we will assume we are taking the high-T limit like this.

Given \EQN~\ref{eqn:Gan_highT_final}, we can now express the \Annealed \PartitionFunction at high-T directly in terms of
the Annelaed (i.e., data-averaged) error $\EPSLw$:
\begin{align}
  \nonumber
  \label{eqn:Zanht_def}
\ZANHT :=  &\int d\mu(\WVEC) e^{-n\beta\GANHT} \\ 
  =  &\int d\mu(\WVEC) e^{-n\beta\EPSLw} 
\end{align}
%Also notice that in the AA,  $Z^{an}_{n,hT}=nZ^{an}_{1,hT}$.
If we assume that at high-T we can make this approximation, 
since we only care about the small $\beta$ results. 
This will prove very useful later when working with HCIZ integrals.

In a \SemiEmpirical approach, the mean-field Hamiltonian is effectively a renormalized \EffectiveHamiltonian, where the parameters are adjusted to account for correlations using empirical data~\cite{Martin1996, Martin1996_CPL, martin_reparametrizing_1998, Freed1983}. \michael{This footnote should be in the intro or a discussion section or somewhere where we make this connection more explicity, not buried here.}\charles{the in}

\subsubsection{Average Training and Generalization Errors and their \GeneratingFunctions}
\label{sxn:mathP_errors}

\michaeladdressed{This is a long subsubsection, and I think it's hard to follow. Let's have an outline of the subsubsection here, and let's stick to it. What is the point of this subsubsection, i.e., what (say) three equatinos are being derived.}
\michael{It may also be good to have somem parts of this subsection just have results stated and move others to a self contained appendix; this is a long and comples subsubsection, and I'm not sure the logical flow.}

In this subsection, we show how to derive the Average \TrainingError $\AVGTE$ and  the \AverageGeneralizationError $\AVGGE$,
in the \AnnealedApproximation (AA), and at high-Temperature (high-T), using the \FreeEnergy $F$ and/or the \PartitionFunction $Z$ as
a generating function.  Importantly, we show that in the AA and at high-T, these errors are (approximately) equal
and equal to the \ThermalAverage of the \EffectivePotential,
$\AVGTE^{an, hT} \approx \AVGGE^{an, hT} \approx \THRMAVGw{\EPSLw}$.
\\
\\
For a summary of these different symbols and terms, see Table~\ref{tab:energies} (in Appendix~\ref{sxn:appendix_A}).

\paragraph{\GeneratingFunctions for the Errors: the \STATMECH way}

In our theory, after applying the AA (AA), we obtain expressions where the
random model data $\NDXIn$ has been integarted out. This leaves formal quantities
that depend only on the weights $\WVEC$, which are the variables being learned during training.
Since we are left with a distribution over $\WVEC$,
we define the training error not explicitly as average over the training data itself,
but instead in terms of how the Free Energy,  $\beta F :=-\ln Z_{n}$,
varies  with $\beta$, i.e., the amount of stochasity in the model weights.

Following ~\cite{LTS90, Solla2023},
we define the \emph{\AverageTrainingError}, in the AA,
by by differentiating $\ln Z^{an}_{n}$ with respect to $\beta$:
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:avgte_def}
  \AVGTE^{an}
  & := -\frac{1}{n}\dfrac{\partial (\ln Z^{an}_{n})}{\partial \beta} \\ \nonumber
  &  = -\frac{1}{n}\frac{1}{Z_{n}}\dfrac{\partial Z^{an}_{n}}{\partial \beta} 
\end{align}
This error captures how the model predictions will vary with changes in the learned
weights $\WVEC$, which implicitly descibes how the changes will vary with the
training data $\NDXIn$.

Similarly, 
we define the \emph{\AverageGeneralizationError}, in the AA,
by differentiating $\ln Z^{an}_{n}$ with respect to $n$, the number of data points.
Following 
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:avgge_def}
  \AVGGE^{an}
&  := -\frac{1}{\beta}\dfrac{\partial (\ln Z^{an}_{n})}{\partial n}    +\frac{1}{\beta}\ln z(\beta)  \\ \nonumber
&  =  -\frac{1}{\beta}\frac{1}{Z_{n}}\dfrac{\partial Z^{an}_{n}}{\partial n}
  +\frac{1}{\beta}\ln z(\beta) 
\end{align}
where $z(\beta)$ is constant normalization term that depends only on $\beta$ (which, moving forward, we ignore, as it only shifts the scale).
This error captures how the model’s predictions will change as more data is introduced.

In the \ThermodynamicLimit $(n \gg 1)$, these two definitions of the error become equivalent at High-T,
and equal to the \ThermalAverage of the \EffectivePotential
\begin{align}
  \AVGTE^{an, hT} = \AVGGE^{an, hT} = \THRMAVGw{\EPSLw}\;,n\gg 1
\end{align}

This is readily seen by considering the \Annealed \PartitionFunction at high-T, $\ZANHT$, in \EQN~\ref{eqn:Zanht_def}.
If we substitute $\ZANHT$ into \EQN~\ref{eqn:avgte_def}, and take the partial deriviative w/r.t $\beta$, we obtain
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:avgte_anhT}
  \AVGGE^{an, hT} :=&\frac{1}{n}\dfrac{\partial (-\ln \ZANHT)}{\partial \beta}  \\ \nonumber
   =& - \dfrac{1}{n}\dfrac{\partial}{\partial \beta}\ln\int d\mu(\WVEC)e^{-\beta n\EPSLw} \\  \nonumber
   =&  \dfrac{
              \tfrac{1}{n}  \int  d\mu(\WVEC) n\EPSLw e^{-\beta n\EPSLw} 
             }{
              \int  d\mu(\WVEC) e^{-\beta n\EPSLw} 
   } \\ \nonumber
   =&\langle\EPSLw \rangle_{\WVEC}^{\beta}
  \end{align}


Likeswise, if we substitute $\ZANHT$ into \EQN~\ref{eqn:avgge_def}, and take the partial deriviative w/r.t. $n$, we obtain
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:avgte_anhT}
    \AVGGE^{an, hT}  :=& \frac{1}{\beta}\dfrac{\partial (-\ln \ZANHT)}{\partial n} \\ \nonumber
    =& - \dfrac{1}{n}\dfrac{\partial}{\partial \beta}\ln\int d\mu(\WVEC)e^{-\beta n\EPSLw} \\  \nonumber
   =&  \dfrac{
              \tfrac{1}{\beta}  \int  d\mu(\WVEC) n\EPSLw e^{-\beta n\EPSLw} 
             }{
     \int  d\mu(\WVEC) e^{-\beta n\EPSLw} 
   } \\ \nonumber
   =&\langle\EPSLw \rangle_{\WVEC}^{\beta}
  \end{align}
  Notice that both of these results arise
  because of the simple expression that appears in the exponent of $\ZANHT$, namely $-n\beta\HANHT(\WVEC)=n\beta\EPSLw$.


This equivalence reflects the fact that, when the system is large enough, adding a new data example to the
training distribution is formaly equivalent to adding noise, making the two errors indistinguishable.
This approach allows us to define both training and generalization errors in terms of fundamental thermodynamic quantities,
providing a simplified formal framework suitable for empirical adjustment later.

Also, note that the model data variables $\XI$ do not enter the calculation because we 
integrated them out before the calculation of \ThermalAverage.
(This illustrates the difference between taking an annealed versus a quenched average.)
Also, our sign convention is consistent with a model of NN training that \emph{minimizes} the total loss
$(\mathcal{L})$ and/or ST error, and, therefore minimizes \FreeEnergies as well.

More generally, we see that we can use the \PartitionFunction, $Z$,
and/or the \FreeEnergy, $\beta F:=-\ln Z$, as a\GeneratingFunction to obtain any
desired Thermodymanic average by taking the appropriate partial derivative
of the correpsonding form of $\ln Z$.
In Appendix~\ref{sxn:XXX} we show how to obtain 
$\AVGTE^{an}$ and $\AVGGE^{an}$ obtain explicitly in this way using $Z^{an}$.


%\paragraph{The Quality $(\Q)$ and its Generating Function $(\Gamma_{\Q})$}
\subsubsection{The Quality $(\Q)$ and its Generating Function $(\Gamma_{\Q})$}
We then explain how to define what we call the \Quality $\Q$, which is
defined as the \ThermalAverage of the \SelfOverlap,  $\Q:=\THRMAVGw{\ETAw}$,
and is obtained from it's associated \emph{\Quality~\GeneratingFunction} $\Gamma_{\Q}$.

For our purposes below, we define the \ModelQuality (as in Eqn.~\ref{eqn:ProductNorm}) as our approximation to the
\AverageGeneralizationAccuracy for our model. 
We denote the \ModelQuality for the ST \Perceptron model, $\Q^{ST}$,
and for a general NN, $\Q^{ST}$, such that
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:model_pre_qualities}
\Q^{ST}:=1-\AVGGE^{ST}  \\ 
\Q^{NN}:=1-\AVGGE^{NN}  
\end{align}
However, in this work, the \Quality will always be defined at high-T, so we may write
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:model_qualities}
  \Q^{ST}=1-[\AVGTE^{ST}]^{an,hT}=1-[\AVGGE^{ST}]^{an,hT} \\
  \Q^{NN}=1-[\AVGTE^{NN}]^{an,hT}=1-[\AVGGE^{NN}]^{an,hT} \\
\end{align}
We also define a \LayerQuality, simply denoted $\Q$,
which will describe the contributions an individual layer makes to the overall \ModelQuality $\Q^{NN}$.
To obtain the \LayerQuality, we define an accuracy--or \Quality--\GeneratingFunction, denoted $\Gamma_{\Q}$, which
is analogous to a layer \FreeEnergy, but with the opposite sign convention.
For example, for the single-layer ST \Perceptron, $\Gamma_{\Q^{ST}}:=n-F^{ST}$
(where $n$ here is also the number of free parameters for this model, and is in units of energy or error).

Generally speaking, the \Quality \GeneratingFunction $\Gamma_{\Q}$ is defined in the AA, and at high-T and is given as
\begin{align}
  \label{ref:defGammaQ}
  \beta\Gamma_{\Q} := \ln\int d\mu(\WVEC) e^{n\beta\ETAw}
\end{align}
The term $\Gamma_{\Q}$ is directly related to the \emph{Total} Free Energy $F$, which can be seen by substituting \EQN~\ref{eqn:def_eta}
for $\ETAw$ in \EQN~\ref{ref:defGammaQ}:
\begin{align}
  \label{ref:defGammaQtoF}
  \beta\Gamma_{\Q^{ST}}
  &= \ln\int d\mu(\WVEC) e^{n\beta(1\red{-}\EPSLw)} \\ \nonumber
    &= \ln\int d\mu(\WVEC) e^{n\beta}e^{\red{-}n\beta\EPSLw} \\ \nonumber
    &= \ln\left(\int d\mu(\WVEC) e^{n\beta}\right)+\ln\left(\int d\mu(\WVEC)e^{\red{-}n\beta\EPSLw}\right) \\ \nonumber
   &= \ln e^{n\beta}+\ln\left(\int d\mu(\WVEC)e^{\red{-}n\beta\EPSLw}\right) \\ \nonumber
  &= \beta n-\beta F^{ST}
\end{align}
Dividing by $n$, we can also recover the more general relation for the \emph{Average} Free Energy,
$\bar{\Gamma}_{\Q}=1-\bar{F}$. For the matrix case we do something similar; see Appendix~\ref{sxn:quality}.

Likewise, one can show that the \Quality $\Q$
(again, always in the AA and at high-T) can be identified as the \ThermalAverage of the (data-averaged or Annealed)
\SelfOverlap, 
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:Q_def_eta}
  \Q = \THRMAVGw{\langle\ETA(\WVEC,\XI)\rangle_{\XI}} =\THRMAVGw{\ETA(\WVEC)}
\end{align}
We can then obtain $\Q$ by taking the appropriate partial derivative of its \GeneratingFunction, $\Gamma_{Q}$.

For technical reasons, however, we will actually define and use a
\GeneratingFunction for the \AverageLayerQualitySquared $\QT$, denoted $\IZG$.
In analogy with Eqns.~\ref{eqn:avgte_def} and ~\ref{eqn:avgge_def}, and at high-T and large-N (explained below),
we can obtain $\QT$ (see Section~\ref{sxn:matgen} Eqn.~\ref{eqn:IZG_generate_Q2}) as
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:QT_def}
  \QT := \lim_{N\gg 1}\frac{1}{\beta}\frac{\partial }{\partial N}\IZG
  \underset{\text{high-}T}{\approx}
\lim_{N\gg 1}\frac{1}{N}\frac{\partial }{\partial \beta}\IZG
\end{align}
See Section~\ref{sxn:matgen} and the Appendix, Section~\ref{sxn:quality} for more details.
\michaeladdressed{Is this $1-F$ thing new to us, or does SST do it; and is the thing you are calling a generating function to ``generate'' it new to us? It is probably worth being a bit more pedantic here. }


\subsubsection{The Thermodynamic Large-N limit and the Saddle Point Approximation (SPA)}
\label{sxn:largeN_and_SPA}
\michaeladdressed{If I am correct, this par is different from above, basically focusing on large $N$ issues. We need some better marking or something.}
To evaluate $\QT$, we take a Large-N limit, which is 
in the \ThermodynamicLimit, which we assume going forward.

Note that technically,  the \ThermodynamicLimit and the Large-N limit are different.
the \ThermodynamicLimit typically refers to the case where all \Thermodynamic averages
remain \SizeIntensive as the system size increases.
And while this does refer to $n=N$ growing large, frequently for NNsthere is an additional
constraint that the ratio $(m/n = M/N)$, i.e., the load, remains constant.\cite{SST92,MM17_TR_v1}
For the ST model of the \Perceptron, however, the \Thermodynamic averages we need to not depend on $m$,
so this constraint is not necessary.
Moreover, later, when we form our matrix gneralization of the ST model, we will not
enforce that $N/M$ remain constant but, instead, the final result will be \SizeConsistent.

Here, the \ThermodynamicLimit is the large-N limit of the model as $n=N$
grows arbitrarily large, i.e. $n \gg 1$.
\michael{We are using $N$ and $n$ and $m$.}
\charles{See above, Notation section}.
To express the average \FreeEnergy $\bar{F}$ in the large-N limit, we can write
\begin{align}
  -\beta\bar{F} = \lim_{n\gg 1}\frac{1}{n}\ln \int d\mu(\WVEC) e^{-n\beta\EPSL(\WVEC)}  .
\end{align}
When this large-N approximation is well behaved,
then the total energy $\DETOT$ is extensive, i.e., when $\DETOT=n\EPSL(\WVEC)$;
and, consequently, the total \FreeEnergy is also extensive, i.e., $F=n\bar{F}$.
This is a cornerstone of statistical mechanics,
as it allows for meaningful macroscopic predictions from microscopic interactions.

\paragraph{\SelfAveraging}

The existence of the limit signifies that the system is \emph{\SelfAveraging}, meaning that
the macroscopic properties are independent of fluctuations, etc.
This also implies that the relevant averages
(i.e., training and generalization errors) are the same for almost all samples, or \emph{realizations of the disorder}.
Additionally, the Annealed and the Quenched averages,
$\ln \langle Z_n \rangle_{\NDXIn}$ and $\langle \ln Z_n \rangle_{\NDXIn}$, respectively,
become sharply peaked, and
\begin{align}
\langle \ln Z_n \rangle_{\NDXIn} \approx \ln \langle Z_n \rangle_{\NDXIn}, \quad \text{as } n \to \infty,
\end{align}
(although they are not strictly equal except at the limit $n = \infty$).
For a NN, \SelfAveraging implies that the weights $\WVEC$ are \emph{\Typical} of the distribution,
and therefore the NN can generalize to similar but unseen test examples.

\paragraph{\SaddlePointApproximation (SPA)}
When the \ThermodynamicLimit exists, 
%%this suggest 
\michaeladdressed{I dont know what ``this suggest means, is it correct if we remove it.}
we can approximate the  \FreeEnergy $F$ 
\michaeladdressed{What are we talking about? Should there be an overbar on that $F$ and the subsequent $Z$?}
\charles{Oh yeha we need to be careful about this; its not critical here.  Z never has a bar in this context}
(and/or the \PartitionFunction $Z$) in the large-N limit
using the \SaddlePointApproximation (SPA) to evaluate the asymptotic behavior of 
integrals we will encounter.
In the case of the $F$ and/or $Z$, we assume that we can apply the SPA:
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:SPA}
  \int d\mu(\WVEC) e^{-n\beta\EPSL(\WVEC)}\approx \sqrt{\tfrac{2\pi}{n\EPSL(\WVEC^{*})}} e^{-n\beta\EPSL(\WVEC^{*})}  ,
\end{align}
where $\WVEC^{*}$ satisfies the saddle point equations:
\begin{align}
  \EPSL(\WVEC^{*}):=\tfrac{\partial}{\partial \WVEC}\EPSL(\WVEC)\vert_{\WVEC=\WVEC^{*}}=0 \\
  \EPSL(\WVEC^{*}):=\tfrac{\partial^{2}}{\partial^{2} \WVEC}\EPSL(\WVEC)\vert_{\WVEC=\WVEC^{*}}>0  .
\end{align}
To apply the SPA rigorously, we expect that $\EPSL(\WVEC)$ decays exponentially,
whereas we will be working with \HeavyTailed (HT)/Power-Law (PL) distributions.
At first glance, this might seem problematic.
These distributions, however, can also be modelled as Truncated Power Laws (TPL) because of the finite-size effects. 
This suggests we can apply the SPA formally, assuming (but not checking) that the finite-size effects will satisfy the requirements we need.
The SPA will play a central role when we evaluate the matrix-generalized form of our model and the HCIZ integrals that arise.

\paragraph{When the limit fails: \ATypical behavior}
We should note that, when the \ThermodynamicLimit fails to exist, the \FreeEnergy will contain additional, non-extensive terms, i.e.,
$F = n\bar{F}_{ex} + n^{1+x}\bar{F}_{non-ex},\;x>0$.
\footnote{When dealing with matrix integrals (below), $F\sim NMF_{0}+\cdots$, when there are $N \times M$ degrees
of freedom~\cite{PP95}, but we will only be concerned with the large-N limit.}
In this case, the AA may fail, the SPA may not apply, and the system may fail to achieve \SelfAveraging.
This causes the system to behave in an \ATypical way, 
possibly converging to a meta-stable and/or glassy phase.
Indeed, when the weights $\WVEC$ are \emph{\ATypical}, they may describe the training data well, 
but they would fail to describe the test data well; in this sense, we say the model is \emph{overfit} to the training data.
We will not explicitly consider a model that is non-extensive; however, we will
present empirical results where we suspect the model is overfit
(i.e., Section~\ref{sxn:empirical-correlation_trap})
and, additionally, where we observe glassy behvior, which we refer to as a \emph{Hysteresis Effect}
(in Section~\ref{sxn:hysteresis_effect}).
\michaeladdressed{This par seems out of place here; it should probably be earlier when we say something about \Replicas.}



\paragraph{Remark.} 
Additional results are provided in Appendix~\ref{sxn:summary_sst92}.
In particular, in Appendix~\ref{app:st-gen-err-annealed-ham}, we use the ideas from this section to derive the full non-linear vector form of the \AnnealedHamiltonian $\GAN$ (\EQN~\ref{eqn:Gan_def})
for the \LinearPerceptron, in the AA, and then we express it at High-T, i.e.,
$\GANHTR=\EPSLR$ (\EQN~\ref{eqn:Gan_highT}).  
Then, in Appendix~\ref{app:st-gen-err-annealed-ham}, we derive the matrix generalization
$\GANR\rightarrow\GANMAT$ of these quantities.
This derivation is necessary to obtain the normalization on the weight matrices $\WMAT$ necessary for the final results in Section~\ref{sxn:matgen}.
\michaeladdressed{MM TO DO: That's a funny sentence; clarify later.}
\michael{This remark/par doesn't really seem to belong here.}


\subsubsection{HCIZ Integrals}
\label{sxn:mathP_hciz}

To generalize the Linear ST \Perceptron (in the AA, and at high-T) from \Perceptron vectors to MLP matrices,
we need to generalize the thermal average over the $m$-dimensional \Perceptron weight vectors $(\WVEC=\SVEC)$
to an integral over NN \Student $N \times M$ weight matrices ($\WMAT=\mathbf{S}$).
\michael{thermal is not in macro.}
The resulting \PartitionFunction and \FreeEnergy will be expressed with what is called an HCIZ integral.
(See Tanaka~\cite{Tanaka2007, Tanaka2008}, Gallucio et al.~\cite{Bouchaud1998} and/or Parisi~\cite{PP95}, and also \EQN~\ref{eqn:tanaka_result} in Section~\ref{sxn:matgen}.)
Analogously to \EQN~\ref{eqn:GammaQdef}, we will define a \emph{\LayerQuality \GeneratingFunction}, $\IZG$, for the \LayerQuality (squared).
This will take the form of an HCIZ integral,
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:hciz_prelim}
%\IZG := \lim_{N\gg 1}\ln \underbrace{\int d\mu(\AMAT) \exp[\beta\Trace{\AMAT\BMAT}] }_{\mbox{HCIZ Integral}} 
%  \approx N\beta\Trace{\mathcal{G}_{A}(\BMAT/N)}  ,
\IZG := \lim_{N\gg 1}\ln \underbrace{\int d\mu(\AMAT) \exp[N\beta\Trace{\AMAT_{\red{2}}\XMAT_{\red{2}}}] }_{\mbox{HCIZ Integral}} 
  \approx N\beta\Trace{\mathcal{G}_{A}(\lambda)}  ,
\end{align}
that is evaluated in the ``large-N limit`` (here, meaning as $N \gg 1$, but not at the limit $N=\infty$).
\michaeladdressed{MM TO DO: fix the following.}
Here,  $\AMAT$ and $\XMAT$ are  $N \times N$ Hermetian matrices, $d\mu(\AMAT)$ is a measure
over all random (Orthogonal) matrices (see \EQN~\ref{eqn:dmuA}),
and $\mathcal{G}_{A}()$ is a \red{(Norm)?} \GeneratingFunction
(different from $\Gamma$, above), defined in \EQN~\ref{eqn:generating_function_A} in Section~\ref{sxn:matgen}. 
In applying this, we will actually write $\Trace{\AMAT\XMAT}=\tfrac{1}{N}\Trace{\AMAT\WMAT\WMAT^{\top}}=\tfrac{1}{N}\Trace{\WMAT^{\top}\AMAT\WMAT}$,
where $\mathbf{W}$ is an $N \times M$ layer weight matrix, and $\AMAT=\AMAT_{2}:=\tfrac{1}{N}\SMAT\SMAT^{\top}$ is a layer
Correlation matrix, and, here,  $\XMAT=\XMAT_2=\tfrac{1}{N}\WMAT\WMAT^{\top}$).
Moreover, to evaluate this, we will need to restrict $\AMAT$ (and $\XMAT$)
to the lower-rank \EffectiveCorrelationSpace (\ECS),  i.e., $\AMAT\rightarrow\AECS$.

Notice this looks similar to \SaddlePointApproximation (SPA), but where the more complicated function
$\GNORM()$ now appears.
Also, $\GNORM()$ here depends on only the limiting form of the ESD of $\AMAT$, $\rho^{\infty}_{A}(\lambda)$,
and depends on the $M$ normalized eigenvalues $\lambda_{i}$ of $\XMAT$.

%%This model dates back to the \emph{\RandomOthogonalModel} (ROM)~\cite{PP95} where the randomness over $\AMAT$ is
%%constrained to the case of all orthogonal transformations $\AMAT=\mathbf{O}\mathbf{\Sigma}\mathbf{O}^{-1}$,
%%where $\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix (with elements $\pm 1$ in the ROM), and $\mathbf{O}$
%%is an arbitrary orthogonal matrix defined by the Haar measure on the orthogonal group.
%%\charles{say more? less ?}  
%%Also, frequently in the literature, the HCIZ integral represents a \FreeEnergy, evaluated at $\beta=1$ for simplicity;
%%here we want to keep the expicit Temperature dependence.

To evaluate this, we will form the large-N limit, using a result from Tanaka~\cite{Tanaka2007,Tanaka2008},
but extended slightly (in Appendix~\ref{sxn:tanaka}) to include the inverse-Temperature $\beta$ explicitly.
We can write
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:izgin_def}
  \IZGINF:=\lim_{N\gg 1}\IZG ,
\end{align}
with the final result
  \begin{align}
    \label{eqn:hciz_tanaka}
    \IZGINF:=N\beta\sum_{i=1}^{\MECS}\int^{\LambdaECS_{i}}_{\LambdaECSmin} dz R(z) ,
\end{align}
where $R(z)$ is a complex function, the \RTransform of the ESD $\rho(\lambda)$ of the \Teacher, and $\LambdaECS_{i}$ are the eigenvalues of \Teacher \CorrelationMatrix $\XECS$, restricted to the~\ECS.
For more details, see Section~\ref{sxn:matgen} and Appendicies~\ref{sxn:TraceLogDerivation} and~\ref{sxn:tanaka}.

\paragraph{Branch Cuts and Phase Behavior}
\nred{ADDED THIS SECTION} \\
Free energies ($F,\Gamma$)  often exhibit \emph{branch cuts} when expressed as analytic functions 
of complex parameters (i.e., temperature, coupling constants, or eigenvalue cutoffs),
and arise from singularities in the underlying integral representations of the partition function $Z$,
When a branch cut occurs, this demarcates non-analytic behavior
and this indicates the onset of a \emph{phase transition} where
macroscopic observables such as correlation lengths and/or variance-like quantities
may diverge or change character abruptly.  

In the context of our HCIZ-based construction, integrating a complex function like the $R(z)$-transform of
a \HeavyTailed ESD can produce precisely this phenomenon.
For example, if $R(z)$ has a square-root term, i.e., $(\sqrt{z-c})$, then it will have a branch cut at $z=c$,
and the \GeneratingFunction (i.e.,  Effective Free Energy) $\IZGINF$
will be non-analytic and we must choose the appropriate, physically meaningful branch, i.e., $(z>c)$,
corresponding to the \ECS.
We argue that this cut signifies a \emph{phase boundary}—an abrupt change
in the system’s correlation structure and corresponds to an emerging singularity in the \LayerQuality.
Even though we perform only a single exact RG step , 
(rather than fully iterating a renormalization flow), the appearance of a branch cut in $\IZGINF$ wil encode
non-trivial \emph{phase-like} behavior in the \SETOL \HeavyTailed matrix model.
