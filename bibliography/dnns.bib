This chapter focuses on semiempirical quantum-chemical methods describing their development over the past 40 years. One of the first semiempirical approaches in quantum chemistry was the p-electron method proposed by Hǖckel (1931) that generates molecular orbitals (MOs) essentially from the connectivity matrix of a molecule and provides valuable qualitative insights into the structure, stability, and spectroscopy of unsaturated molecules. Hoffmann extended this approach to include all valence electrons and applied in many qualitative studies of inorganic and organometallic compounds. These early semiempirical methods had a lasting impact on chemical thinking as they guided the development of qualitative MO theory that is commonly employed for rationalizing chemical phenomena in terms of orbitals interactions. They are normally not used any longer as computational tools. After a survey of the established methods such as MNDO, AM1, and PM3, recent methodological advances are described including the development of improved semiempirical models, new general-purpose and special-purpose parametrizations, and linear scaling approaches.}

abstract = {We consider in this letter the pseudo-inverse solution for the learning of a binary classification. We address the problem of overfitting, i.e. the fact that the generalization rate can be relatively low although the learning rate is very high. We interpret this phenomenon with respect to the behaviour of the small eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the learned patterns. We propose two ways for solving this problem: the first one is linear, the second one is a two-layer perceptron. Numerical simulations are given to illustrate these approaches.}

abstract = {Gradient descent training of neural networks can be done in either a batch or on-line manner. A widely held myth in the neural network community is that batch training is as fast or faster and/or more ‘correct’ than on-line training because it supposedly uses a better approximation of the true gradient for its weight updates. This paper explains why batch training is almost always slower than on-line training—often orders of magnitude slower—especially on large training sets. The main reason is due to the ability of on-line training to follow curves in the error surface throughout each epoch, which allows it to safely use a larger learning rate and thus converge with less iterations through the training data. Empirical results on a large (20,000-instance) speech recognition task and on 26 other learning tasks demonstrate that convergence can be reached significantly faster using on-line training than batch training, with no apparent difference in accuracy.}
