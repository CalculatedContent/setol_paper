1) added macro \Expected
Can now switch between \mathbb{E}[] and <>
See, however, sec 4.2

2) added figure 8b, sphere

3) add eta macro \ETA
so it could be changed
notice:  \eta is the greek symbol for lower case H, so like an energy

*We need to discuss this and \epsilon in section 4,
introduce \ETA as a measure of accuracy or quality

4) changed 400, 500, & 600 the way we do "section outlines"
now using enumerate, not itemiz
removed 510 subsection header (520 is now 5.1, etc)
added 510_new.tex

5) added comments on branch cuts and ECS at end of Sec 3

6) cleaned up A2, A3...
A normalization clearer
NM scaling clearer
introduced h(R)^{an}  lower case H
clarified what \epsilon(R) is for matrix case

7) other new macros
\newcommand{\DeltaMu}{\vartheta_{\mu}}
\newcommand{\IM}{\mathbf{I}_{M}} % identity operator
\newcommand{\IH}{\mathbb{I}_{H}} % integral

8) Cleaning up tables in A1
more to do
We need to settle on this

9) Removed section 560 and 640
file numbering may be off again, be careful

10) completed Table 4

11) created stuff (file)
extra stuff there
